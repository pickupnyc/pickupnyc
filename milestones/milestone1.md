## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well this unit is that we completed all the required tasks, including creating a container diagram, wireframes, an entity relationship diagram, and initializing the initial project structure. Along with the technical work, we also handled the project management tasks to keep everything organized and on track.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The challenges we faced this unit included deciding on our tech stack and determining how our machine learning model would be deployed, specifically whether to use Flask or AWS Lambda. We also still have to make decisions on how to deploy the project and where to host the database.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Overall, I think we are in a good place, but it would be helpful to have someone review our architecture to ensure it makes sense and offer insights on how to address the challenges we're facing. Specifically, guidance on deployment options and database hosting would be beneficial.
