## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to complete almost all of the wireframes for the pages on our site and finish the entity relationship diagram. We have now started coding the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We haven't faced any challenges so far in this unit, except that we're still missing one wireframe for our data visualization and match predictor page.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Right now, we're in a good spot, but it might be helpful to have someone review our architecture to ensure everything looks good.
